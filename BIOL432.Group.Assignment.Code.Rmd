## Dataset Description 
  The original dataset selected was published by [Bahlai et al. (2014)](https://link-springer-com.proxy.queensu.ca/article/10.1007/s10530-014-0772-4#Sec2) and used data from a multi-year study conducted on a ladybeetle (Coccinellidae) community in southwestern Michigan. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanism behind the decline of native Coccinellidae species and generate potential conservation strategies. 
  Data were collected in southern Michigan on an experimental farm and forest area. Forest sampling began in 1993, so data before this time does not include the forest community classification. Adult coccinellids were captured using un-baited yellow sticky pads suspended in the air. As this sampling technique may be more efficient in some habitats than other habitats, we will focus our analysis within habitat types to minimize bias. The time period covered by this dataset includes several important ecological events, including the introduction of non-native competitors (alien coccinellid species) and prey (soybean aphids).
	The first, second and third variables describe collection dates in the form of year; day, month and year (DD-Month-YYYY); and ordinal day of the year, respectively. The fourth variable describes how the plot was managed (e.g. conventional tilling, organic, etc.), if at all. The fifth variable records the habitat type (i.e. the plant community growing in the plot). This differs from the management treatment due to crop rotation. The sixth variable is the plant community classification (annual, perennial, or forest). The seventh variable is the plot replicate number. The eighth variable is the sample station number; there are five stations per plot. The ninth variable is the species ID; there are 13 species in total. Finally, the tenth variable describes the total number of adults captured in a subsample during a week. See Table 1 for a better understanding of the variables within the dataset.
	Bahlai et al. (2014) concluded that the decreasing abundance of native Coccinellidae species was due to competitive exploitation driven by dietary overlap with alien Coccinellidae species. Our project will examine whether seasonal niche partitioning is occurring among and between native and non-native coccinellids.
	
There are 13 species of Ladybeetle documented in this study. 9 species are native, while the remaining 4 are non-native invase species.

**We seek to address the following questions:**

1. Within sampling years, does native and non-native species abundance change according to the month?

2. Is there temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species? Is there temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species?

3. Is there a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species arrive?

\n 

**Hypotheses for each question: ** 

1. **H0**: Native and non-native species abundance does not change according to the month within sampling years. **H1**: Native and non-native species abundance does change according to the month within sampling years. We suspect that native and non-native species abundance will change according to month because abundance may be impacted by environmental factors that vary seasonally. 

2. **H0**: There is not temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species. There is not temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species. **H1**: There is temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species. There is temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species. We suspect that there will be temporal niche partitioning because native and non-native species may compete. 

3. **H0**: There is not a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species arrive. **H1**: There is a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species arrive. We suspect that there will be changes in seasonal partitioning before and after the arrival of invasive species (soybean aphids) because they may impact non-native and native species. 

\n 

**Predictions for each question:** 

1. If native and non-native species abundance changes according to the month within sampling years, then graphs will may show monthly changes in species abundance and clusters may show changes in lady beetle communities according to month. 

2. If there is temporal niche partitioning among native and non-native species, then graphs and community clusters may show that when one species has high abundance, then another species will have lower abundance. If there is temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species, then graphs and community clusters may show that when non-native species have high abundance, then native species have low abundance and vice versa. 

3. If there is a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species (soybean aphids) arrive, then graphs and community clusters will show changes in temporal niche partitioning. For example, non-native species may be at a high abundance during a month when they were previously low abundance.

```

# Is there temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species? Is there temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species?

## Make trees to cluster the species by differences in abundance by DOY

To determine if there is temporal niche partitioning between species, we first attempt to cluster the species by differences in abundance for each day of the year (DOY) (pooled across all years within a given time frame). The clustering method we chose was the neighbour-joining (NJ) tree method. We predict that this will reveal any differences in the temporal patterns of abundance between species. This does not tell us if species partition resources 'seasonally', i.e. the clusters will not reveal specific time periods when certain species become more abundant and other species become less abundant. However, the trees should indicate which species are similar to each other in terms of their temporal patterns of abundance and which are dissimilar.

*Maybe make a note that we tried NMDS, but decided it doesn't make sense*

### Make a data.frame indicating the native/non-native status of each species

Will need this later to colour code the species tree by native and non-native species to see if there are any clusters in abundance by DOY

```{r}
# Select the species names and their corresponding status as native or non-native from the original dataset, and remove the duplicate rows using the distinct() function from dplyr
SpeciesOrigin <- LadyBugData %>% select(SpeciesID, Species_type) %>% distinct()
```

### Plot histograms of the abundance data

```{r}
# Plot counts for the raw abundance data (for each observation)
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=(Adults), y=..count..))+
  geom_histogram()
```

There is a wide range in abundances. It is possible that certain species might be less abundant in the dataset compared to others. To get an idea of how often each species is represented in the dataset:
```{r}
# Sum up the abundances for each species in the entire dataset
LadyBugData %>% group_by(SpeciesID) %>% summarise(totalAbun = sum(Adults, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Certain species are indeed far more common in the dataset than others. Log-transforming the dataset might allow us to de-emphasize the importance of highly abundant species so that rare species can have more influence in the analysis. This is especially important for comparing native and non-native species because two of the most abundant species in the dataset are non-native (*C. septempuncta* and *H. axyridis*). If raw abundance data is analyzed, the clusters in the trees might just reflect differences in abundance instead of differences in temporal patterns of abundance between species.

- *Still, it's worth noting that the traps are more likely to catch the most abundant species, so the plots will still be biased towards finding differences between abundant and non-abundant species.* This is probably important to mention somewhere, probably in the discussion

See how the distribution of abundances looks with different log transformations:
```{r}
# Add 1 to each abundance value prior to log transforming to prevent 0 values from becoming undefined. Since logx(1), where x is any base, equals 0, the 0 abundance values will simply return to being 0.
# Higher log bases give less weight to more abundant species and let rare species have more influence.

# Try log base 2
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=log((Adults + 1), base = 2), y=..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log2(Adults)")

# Try log base 5
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=log((Adults + 1), base = 5), y=..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log5(Adults)")

# Try log base 10
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=log((Adults + 1), base = 10), y=..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log10(Adults)")
```

For the following analyses we chose to use a log5(x+1) transformation of the abundance data. Inreasing the log transformation to log15(x+1) had no effect on the topologies of the habitat-subsetted trees (including all years) below.

For at least one tree (forest data, including all years), switching from log transformed data to the raw abundance data had little effect on the topology. It is interesting though that the only effect of switching to the raw abundance data is that 2 non-native species (*C. septempunctata* and *H. axyridis*) became closer to each other, probably reflecting their high abundance relative to most of the other species (data not shown).

```{r}
# Log transform the abundance data with the transformation log5(x+1)
logTLadyBug <- LadyBugData %>%
  mutate(logTAdults = log((Adults + 1), base = 5)) %>%  # transform with log5
  select(-Adults) # Replace Adults with logTAdults
```

### Custom Functions for Creating the Trees

This funtion creates distance matrices for pairwise comparisons in abundance by DOY (day of year) between species:
```{r}
# This function is applied after the abundance data is log transformed, pooled across the years within groups of DOY + SpeciesID + TYPE, and subsetted by habitat type and/or time period

mk_distmat <- function(sum_abun_dat){
  
  # Make a matrix of species abundances where the rows are the individual species and the columns are days of the year (DOY) for each habitat type:
  
  sum_abun_dat <- sum_abun_dat %>% pivot_wider(names_from = DOY, values_from = SumAbun) # Rearrange the dataset so abundance data is arranged as separate DOY columns
  sum_abun_dat <- data.frame(sum_abun_dat) # Convert from grouped data to a regular data.frame object
  row.names(sum_abun_dat) <- sum_abun_dat$SpeciesID # Set the SpeciesIDs as the row names in the data.frame
  sum_abun_dat <- sum_abun_dat %>% select(-SpeciesID, -TYPE) # Remove speciesID and habitat type from dataset so dist() can be run on it
  
  # Make the distance matrix:
  
  distmat <- vegdist(sum_abun_dat, method = "bray", na.rm = TRUE) # Use Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to calculate distance matrix. Na values were removed to allow vegdist() to work
  
  return(distmat)
}
```

This function plots the distance matrices as heat maps:
```{r}
# This function makes heat maps that display the distance matrices with white representing no difference in temporal abundance between species and red representing the highest pairwise distance between species

p_dist <- function(distmat){
  Pdat <- melt(as.matrix(distmat)) # Linearize the distance matrix so that it lists the pairwise combinations of species with their distances
  hMap <- ggplot(data = Pdat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value)) +
    geom_tile() + # Makes heat map
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours=c("white","blue","green","red")) + # Assigns colours to distance values
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) # Makes axis labels readable
  return(hMap)
}
```

This function creates neighbour-joining (NJ) trees from a distance matrix:
```{r}
# This function makes the NJ trees and plots them as well

mk_tree <- function(distmat, dat = SpeciesOrigin){
  tree <- njs(distmat) # njs allows for missing values in the distance matrix
  pTree <- ggtree(tree, layout = "rectangular") %<+% dat + # Use SpeciesOrigin data.frame to colour-code the species by Species_type (Native or Non-native)
    geom_tiplab(aes(colour = Species_type)) +
    scale_colour_discrete(direction = -1) + # Make non-natives red and natives blue, which is the opposite of the default colour scheme
    xlim_tree(1) # Set x-axis limits for the tree so that the tip-labels don't get cut off
  return(pTree)
}
```


### Subset by habitat type

There are 3 habitat types:

- forest

- annual cropland

- perennial cropland

```{r}
# Pool the abundance data across the years within groups of DOY + SpeciesID + TYPE
datAbunSum <- logTLadyBug %>% group_by(DOY, SpeciesID, TYPE) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE))

# Subset the data by habitat type
forestAbunSum <- datAbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "forest")
annualAbunSum <- datAbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "annual")
perennialAbunSum <- datAbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "perennial")
```

Create distance matrices and neighbor-joining trees:
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
# Make distance matrices using the custom mk_distmat() function
forest.dist <- mk_distmat(forestAbunSum)
annual.dist <- mk_distmat(annualAbunSum)
perennial.dist <- mk_distmat(perennialAbunSum)

# Make heat maps that display the distance matrices with white representing no difference in temporal abundance between species and red representing the highest pairwise distance between species
# Use the custom p_dist() function to do this
forest.hMap <- p_dist(forest.dist)
annual.hMap <- p_dist(annual.dist)
perennial.hMap <- p_dist(perennial.dist)

# Plot the heat maps for each habitat type subset together as a single figure
plot_grid(forest.hMap, annual.hMap, perennial.hMap, labels = c("A", "B", "C"))
```
Figure 1.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
# Make the trees
forest.pT <- mk_tree(forest.dist)
annual.pT <- mk_tree(annual.dist)
perennial.pT <- mk_tree(perennial.dist)

# Plot the trees for each habitat type subset together as a single figure
plot_grid(forest.pT, annual.pT, perennial.pT, labels = c("A", "B", "C"))
```
Figure 2.

### Subset the habitat types by time period

There are 4 time periods defined by the presence of non-native ladybeetles and soybean aphid outbreaks:

- 1989 - 1993 (T1): one non-native ladybeetle present

- 1994 - 1998 (T2): two non-native ladybeetles present

- 1999 - 2006 (T3): three non-native ladybeetles present + soybean aphid outbreaks

- 2007 - 2012 (T4): four non-native ladybeetles present + soybean aphids present

Subset the data:
```{r}
# Split the dataset into subsets for relevant time periods. Then repeat the above analyses for each habitat type in each time period

T1 <- logTLadyBug %>% filter(Year == c(1989:1993))
T2 <- logTLadyBug %>% filter(Year == c(1994:1998))
T3 <- logTLadyBug %>% filter(Year == c(1999:2006))
T4 <- logTLadyBug %>% filter(Year == c(2007:2012))

# Pool the abundance data for station, plot, treatment, across the years within groups of DOY + SpeciesID + TYPE
T1AbunSum <- T1 %>% group_by(DOY, SpeciesID, TYPE) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE))
T2AbunSum <- T2 %>% group_by(DOY, SpeciesID, TYPE) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE))
T3AbunSum <- T3 %>% group_by(DOY, SpeciesID, TYPE) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE))
T4AbunSum <- T4 %>% group_by(DOY, SpeciesID, TYPE) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE))

# Subset the pooled abundance data for each time period by habitat type
T1.F.AbunSum <- T1AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "forest") # This subset will not be analyzed. The forest site only started getting sampled in 1993. There are only 16 observations, and the pooled abundances are all 0 values, so it is not possible to see how the species cluster in DOY abundance.
T1.A.AbunSum <- T1AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "annual")
T1.P.AbunSum <- T1AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "perennial")

T2.F.AbunSum <- T2AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "forest") # This subset could not be analyzed with an NJ tree. See below (where the trees are made) for details.
T2.A.AbunSum <- T2AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "annual")
T2.P.AbunSum <- T2AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "perennial")

T3.F.AbunSum <- T3AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "forest")
T3.A.AbunSum <- T3AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "annual")
T3.P.AbunSum <- T3AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "perennial")

T4.F.AbunSum <- T4AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "forest")
T4.A.AbunSum <- T4AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "annual")
T4.P.AbunSum <- T4AbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "perennial")
```

Make distance matrices from DOY species abundances for each time period in each habitat type:
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
# Make distance matrices using the custom mk_distmat() function
T1.A.dist <- mk_distmat(T1.A.AbunSum)
T1.P.dist <- mk_distmat(T1.P.AbunSum)

T2.F.dist <- mk_distmat(T2.F.AbunSum)

T4.P.dist <- mk_distmat(T4.P.AbunSum)

# Make heat maps that display the distance matrices with white representing no difference in temporal abundance between species and red representing the highest pairwise distance between species
# Use the custom p_dist() function to do this
T1.A.hMap <- p_dist(T1.A.dist)

T4.A.hMap <- p_dist(T4.A.dist)
T4.P.hMap <- p_dist(T4.P.dist)
```

Plot the heat maps by time period for each habitat type together as a single figure
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
# Plot the heat maps for each time period in the forest habitat together as a single figure
# Note that there was too little data for the forest habitat in the first time period do it is not analyzed.
plot_grid(T2.F.hMap, T3.F.hMap, T4.F.hMap, labels = c("A", "B", "C"))
```


```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
# Plot the heat maps for each time period in the annual habitat together as a single figure
plot_grid(T1.A.hMap, T2.A.hMap, T3.A.hMap, T4.A.hMap, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
```


```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}

plot_grid(T1.P.hMap, T2.P.hMap, T3.P.hMap, T4.P.hMap, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
```

Make trees from the distance matrices for each time period in each habitat type:

T1.P.tree <- mk_tree(T1.P.dist)

# T2.F.tree <- mk_tree(T2.F.dist) An njs tree could not be constructed for the forest data in time period 2.

```


```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
# Plot the trees for each time period in the forest habitat together as a single figure
plot_grid(T1.P.tree, T2.P.tree, T3.P.tree, T4.P.tree, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
```

So there's a alternatives to clustering by trees:

1. Try a PCoA plot to cluster the data instead (seemed to be suggested when I tried googling the warning "stress is (nearly) zero: you may have insufficient data"). If we do this, it'll be good to say why we didn't use NMDS. Downside is that we didn't cover it in class, so the prof and TAs might not like that?

###### I think our way around this is to leave the current NMDS plots and code in our report and just dont run it - that way we can show we tried it but after research found a better fit method. 

2. If we still want to do NMDS: Build a distance matrix from a dataset more similar to what we did in class, with species compositions across the columns instead of DOY abundances. *The only issue is that we wouldn't be able to colour the tree or NMDS plot by native vs non-native* because we wouldn't be comparing individual species for differences in abundance patterns, instead each row in the dataset would represent species composition (which can't be classified as native or non-native). So it wouldn't tell us if there's temporal partitioning by DOY between species or native and non-native species, it would only tell us if there different times of year have distinct species compositions.


> A final note for these tree analyses: I wonder if part of the differences between species on the tree might reflect differences in the dates each species was sampled (i.e if some species only have data recorded for certain parts of the year while other species have data recorded for other parts of the year then maybe the pairwise distances between them partly reflect that?). Perhaps we could do histograms for the distributions of observation dates for the different species to see if there's any major differences.

> To possibily address the above point (not sure if it actully does), I tried replacing the NA values in the forest.specDOY object with 0s using the values_fill argument in the pivot_wider() function, but that didn't change the tree that was based off DOY abundances. However the tree built from YrDOY abundances did have it's topology changed when the NAs were switched to 0, but still there was little change in the overall pattern of Non-native plants being scattered throughout the tree (with only CSEPT and HAXY being reasonably close).



### A plot for demonstration of the custom function
 
```{r}
tempAbundancePlot <- ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x = DOY, y = Adults)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
tempAbundancePlot
```


## General temporal abundance patterns

Plot ladybeetle abundance against the day of the year to determine if abundance varies at all over time. Display this data separately for each individual habitat type (annual, forest, perennial) because the sampling method used to capture the ladybeetles may have been more efficient in some habitats than other habitats *(find Bahlai et al 2013 and cite it)*.
```{r}
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x = DOY, y = Adults)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```


Clearly abundance does vary over time, but not necessarily exactly according to month. Let's examine how well this pattern holds for individual species as well as native vs non-native assemblages.

## Temporal abundance of native vs non-native ladybeetles

Plotting abundance w/ native and non-native groupings
```{r}
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()

# Trying the same thing as above but with the log transformed dataset
ggplot(logTLadyBug, aes(x = DOY, y = logTAdults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

Non-native ladybeetles clearly have higher abundance throughout the entire year in most habitats. There doesn't seem to be strong patterns in forest habitat for native ladybeetles, but this might just be because they have such low abundance. Taking a look at abundance pre-invasion of the various exotic species should help show what's going on.

Also, in annual crop habitats there seems to be a decline in non-native ladybeetle abundance and a concurrent increase in native ladybeetle abundance around 2/3 of the way through the year, lending support to our hypothesis of temporal niche partitioning.


## Pre-invasion temporal abundance patterns

1989 - 1993: one non-native ladybeetles
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1989:1993), TYPE != "forest") %>% # Filter the desired years and remove forest data (forest site only started getting sampled in 1993, so there is not enough data for this time frame)
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```
Native species are already low in abundance by this point, but seem to do well at the beginning and end of growing seasons.

1994 - 1998: two non-native ladybeetles
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1994:1998)) %>% # Filtering desired years, forests were present by this time period so they are left in the dataset
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

There is a very interesting change in abundance patterns for annual crops. There is now a second peak in abundance on non-native species at the end of the growing season.

Graphing by individual species (replace "Species_type" with "SpeciesID") shows that the increase in native abundance of is driven almost entirely by one species:
```{r}
LadyBugData$Adults <- as.numeric(LadyBugData$Adults)
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1994:1998)) %>% # Filtering desired years, forests were present by this time period so they are left in the dataset
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = SpeciesID)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```



1999 - 2006: three non-native ladybeetles + soybean aphid outbreaks
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1999:2006)) %>% #filtering desired years
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

During this time period, a new, exotic ladybeetle species arrived and there were repeated soybean aphid outbreaks. Things get a little weird....

2007 - 2012: four non-native ladybeetles + soybean aphids present
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(2007:2012)) %>% #filtering desired years
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

That pattern of mid to late season niche partitioning becomes very apparent in annual cropland. Potentially related to agricultural activities (e.g. harvest)? Digging into the patterns for specific treatment types might explain more.

```{r}
LadyBugData %>% filter(TYPE == "annual", Year == c(2007:2012)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = TREAT_DESC)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 1, se = F) +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```



## Conclusion

Overall, abundance certainly varies over time and we see some evidence for niche partitioning at this stage. Invasion of new species also definitely has an impact on patterns.
