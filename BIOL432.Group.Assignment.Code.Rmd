## Dataset Description 
  The original dataset selected was published by [Bahlai et al. (2014)](https://link-springer-com.proxy.queensu.ca/article/10.1007/s10530-014-0772-4#Sec2) and used data from a multi-year study conducted on a ladybeetle (Coccinellidae) community in southwestern Michigan. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanism behind the decline of native Coccinellidae species and generate potential conservation strategies. 
  Data were collected in southern Michigan on an experimental farm and forest area. Forest sampling began in 1993, so data before this time does not include the forest community classification. Adult coccinellids were captured using un-baited yellow sticky pads suspended in the air. As this sampling technique may be more efficient in some habitats than other habitats, we will focus our analysis within habitat types to minimize bias. The time period covered by this dataset includes several important ecological events, including the introduction of non-native competitors (alien coccinellid species) and prey (soybean aphids).
	The first, second and third variables describe collection dates in the form of year; day, month and year (DD-Month-YYYY); and ordinal day of the year, respectively. The fourth variable describes how the plot was managed (e.g. conventional tilling, organic, etc.), if at all. The fifth variable records the habitat type (i.e. the plant community growing in the plot). This differs from the management treatment due to crop rotation. The sixth variable is the plant community classification (annual, perennial, or forest). The seventh variable is the plot replicate number. The eighth variable is the sample station number; there are five stations per plot. The ninth variable is the species ID; there are 13 species in total. Finally, the tenth variable describes the total number of adults captured in a subsample during a week. See Table 1 for a better understanding of the variables within the dataset.
	Bahlai et al. (2014) concluded that the decreasing abundance of native Coccinellidae species was due to competitive exploitation driven by dietary overlap with alien Coccinellidae species. Our project will examine whether seasonal niche partitioning is occurring among and between native and non-native coccinellids.
	
There are 13 species of Ladybeetle documented in this study. 9 species are native, while the remaining 4 are non-native invase species.

**We seek to address the following questions:**

1. Within sampling years, does native and non-native species abundance change according to the month?

2. Is there temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species? Is there temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species?

3. Is there a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species arrive?

\n 

**Hypotheses for each question: ** 

1. **H0**: Native and non-native species abundance does not change according to the month within sampling years. **H1**: Native and non-native species abundance does change according to the month within sampling years. We suspect that native and non-native species abundance will change according to month because abundance may be impacted by environmental factors that vary seasonally. 

2. **H0**: There is not temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species. There is not temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species. **H1**: There is temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species. There is temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species. We suspect that there will be temporal niche partitioning because native and non-native species may compete. 

3. **H0**: There is not a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species arrive. **H1**: There is a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species arrive. We suspect that there will be changes in seasonal partitioning before and after the arrival of invasive species (soybean aphids) because they may impact non-native and native species. 

\n 

**Predictions for each question:** 

1. If native and non-native species abundance changes according to the month within sampling years, then graphs will may show monthly changes in species abundance and clusters may show changes in lady beetle communities according to month. 

2. If there is temporal niche partitioning among native and non-native species, then graphs and community clusters may show that when one species has high abundance, then another species will have lower abundance. If there is temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species, then graphs and community clusters may show that when non-native species have high abundance, then native species have low abundance and vice versa. 

3. If there is a change in seasonal partitioning before and after invasive species (soybean aphids) arrive, then graphs and community clusters will show changes in temporal niche partitioning. For example, non-native species may be at a high abundance during a month when they were previously low abundance.

## Making A Custom Function

This function will create a custom theme for our ggplots. 

```{r eval=FALSE} 
# eval=FALSE is used in order to show code but not include long output generated

theme_custom <- function () {
  # Using theme_minimal as a base. Will replace elements that we want to change.
  theme_minimal() %+replace% 
  theme(
    # Changing grid elements
    axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "black"), 
    # Changing axis text
    axis.text = element_text(size = rel(0.8), colour="black"),
    # Changing facet title text
    strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1), colour = "black"),
    #add an axis line 
    axis.line = element_line(colour = 'black', size = 1)
  )
}
```

# Is there temporal niche partitioning among native species and among non-native species? Is there temporal niche partitioning between native and non-native species?

## Make plots to cluster the species by similarity in their presence/absence by DOY.

Note that this does not tell us if the species partition resources 'seasonally', but it should tell us if there is any temporal partitioning between species or between natives and non-natives by DOY.

I initially used presence/absence instead of abundance, and then tried abundance.

- I figured that because Non-native species are so much more abundant than native species in general, clusters in the analysis might just reflect this difference in abundance. I think presence/absence should give us a better idea of differences between species in terms of their occurence throughout the year.

- Still, it's worth noting that the traps are more likely to catch the most abundant species, so the plots will still be biased towards finding differences between abundant and non-abundant species.


Creating native and non-native groups
```{r}
# Create another column in the dataset that assigns non-native species to the 'Non-native' group and assign all other species to the 'Native' group
LadyBugData <- LadyBugData %>%
  mutate(Species_type = ifelse(SpeciesID == "C. septempunctata" |
                                 SpeciesID == "H. axyridis" |
                                 SpeciesID == "H. variegata" |
                                 SpeciesID == "P. quatuordecimpunctata",
                               "Non-native", "Native"))
```


##### Make sure to subset by invasion period and aphid outbreak period later


### Make a data.frame indicating the native/non-native status of each species

Will need this to compare native and non-native species

```{r}
# Select the species names and their corresponding status as native or non-native from the original dataset, and remove the duplicate rows using the distinct() function from dplyr
SpeciesOrigin <- LadyBugData %>% select(SpeciesID, Species_type) %>% distinct()
```

### Plot histograms of the count data

```{r}
# Plot counts for the raw abundance data (for each observation)
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=(Adults), y=..count..))+
  geom_histogram()
```

There is a wide range in abundances. It is possible that certain species might be less abundant in the dataset compared to others. To get an idea of how often each species is represented in the dataset:
```{r}
# Sum up the abundances for each species in the entire dataset
LadyBugData %>% group_by(SpeciesID) %>% summarise(totalAbun = sum(Adults, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Certain species are indeed far more common in the dataset than others. Log-transforming the dataset might allow us to de-emphasize the importance of 

See how the distribution of abundances looks with log transformations:
```{r}
# Add 1 to each abundance value prior to log transforming to prevent 0 values from becoming undefined. Since logx(1), where x is any base, equals 0, the 0 abundance values will simply return to being 0.
# Higher log bases give less weight to more abundant species and let rare species have more influence.

# Try log base 2
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=log((Adults + 1), base = 2), y=..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log2(Adults)")

# Try log base 5
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=log((Adults + 1), base = 5), y=..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log5(Adults)")

# Try log base 10
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=log((Adults + 1), base = 10), y=..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log10(Adults)")

# log base = Inf scales the data to pure presence/absence in the decostand function
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x=decostand(Adults, method = "log", logbase = Inf, na.rm = T)), y=..count..)+
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "log.Inf(Adults)")
```

For now let's try a log5(x+1) transformation of the abundance data. It should be pretty easy to switch between the transformations though.

### Try clustering the abundance data using distance matrices and neighbor-joining trees

#### Try abundance data instead:
```{r}
# Log transform the abundance data using decostand? from the vegan package
logTLadyBug <- LadyBugData %>%
  mutate(logTAdults = log((Adults + 1), base = 5)) %>%  # transform with log5
  select(-Adults) # Replace Adults with logTAdults
  
#logTLadyBug <- LadyBugData %>%
#  mutate(logTAdults = decostand(LadyBugData$Adults, method = "log", 
#                                logbase = Inf, na.rm = T)) %>%  # make abundance data presence/absence
#  select(-Adults) # Replace Adults with logTAdults

# Could add a step here to split the dataset into subsets for relevant time periods. Would have to do the following steps separately for each time period.

# Pool the abundance data for station, plot, treatment, across the years within groups of DOY + SpeciesID + TYPE
datAbunSum <- logTLadyBug %>% group_by(DOY, SpeciesID, TYPE) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE))

# Make matrices of species abundances where the rows are the individual species and the columns are days of the year (DOY) for each habitat type

# For forest habitat:
forest.specDOY <- datAbunSum %>% filter(TYPE == "forest") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = DOY, values_from = SumAbun) # Rearrange data.frame so abundance data is arranged as separate DOY columns

forest.specDOY <- data.frame(forest.specDOY) # Convert from grouped data to a regular data.frame object

row.names(forest.specDOY) <- forest.specDOY$SpeciesID

forest.specDOY <- data.frame(forest.specDOY) %>% select(-SpeciesID, -TYPE) # Remove speciesID and habitat type from dataset so dist() can be run on it
```


```{r}
# Make distance matrix
forest.dist <- vegdist(forest.specDOY, method = "bray", na.rm = TRUE) # For now try bray-curtis dissimilarity. Will later try to find alternate distance of dissimilarity metrics in vegdist that control for biases caused by excessive abundance in particular species

# Display distance matrix with white representing no difference in temporal abundance between species and red representing the highest pairwise distance between species
PFdat <- melt(as.matrix(forest.dist))
ggplot(data = PFdat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=c("white","blue","green","red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) 
```
With log10 transformation all the species are really distinct from each other.
This makes sense because taking differences in abundance into account should amplify the differences between species relative to just presence/absence.

The distance between HTRE and HCONV seems undefined. Let's see how well represented they are in the forest subset:
```{r}
# Sum up the DOY abundnaces for each species
rowSums(forest.specDOY, na.rm=T)
```
HCONV and HTRE both have 0 observations. I think this results in undefined bray-curtis dissimilarity values. Undefined values do not occur when you switch the distance metric to 'euclidean', however 'euclidean' does not distinguish among the species as well. Also switching to euclidean doesn't seem to affect the topology of the tree much but the branch lengths become very uneven.


```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
# Make Neighbor-joining tree
forest.tree <- njs(forest.dist) # njs allows for missing values in the distance matrix

ggtree(forest.tree, layout = "rectangular") %<+% SpeciesOrigin + # Use SpeciesOrigin data.frame to colour-code the species by Species_type (Native or Non-native)
  geom_tiplab(aes(colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_colour_discrete(direction = -1) + # Make non-natives red and natives blue, which is the opposite of the default
  xlim_tree(0.65) # Set x-axis limits for the tree so that the tip-labels don't get cut off
```
Some notes about what happened when I tried switching log transformations:

- Switching from the log5(x+1) transformation to the raw abundance data gave almost identical trees. The only difference was that C. septempunctata became closer to H. axyridis than C. munda.
- log5(x+1) and log10(x+1) transformations give identical trees


Tried using NMDS (it doesn't work if you set distance method to bray-curtis dissimilarity)


metaMDS() returns the warning: 'stress is (nearly) zero: you may have insufficient data'. Try plotting it anyways to see what it looks like.





It seems like the NMDS coordinates have really small variation compared to the plots from tutorials and assignments. I wonder if it might have to do with the relatively small number of pairwise comparisons made in the distance matrix (13x13=169) - at least that's my best guess from googling.

Also, the bottom of the documentation page for metaMDS() (under 'Note') says that the default values for the metaMDS function are designed for use with community data (which I assume would mean having species compositions in the rows of the dataset that the distance matrix is built from instead of DOY abundances as I have it here). So regardless of the above point it's probably best not to run NMDS on the dataset as I have it set up above.

So there's 3 options (that I can think of anyways):

1. Try a PCoA plot to cluster the data instead (seemed to be suggested when I tried googling the warning "stress is (nearly) zero: you may have insufficient data"). If we do this, it'll be good to say why we didn't use NMDS. Downside is that we didn't cover it in class, so the prof and TAs might not like that?

###### I think our way around this is to leave the current NMDS plots and code in our report and just dont run it - that way we can show we tried it but after research found a better fit method. 

2. Just cluster the data based off trees (probably easiest).

3. If we still want to do NMDS: Build a distance matrix from a dataset more similar to what we did in class, with species compositions across the columns instead of DOY abundances. *The only issue is that we wouldn't be able to colour the tree or NMDS plot by native vs non-native* because we wouldn't be comparing individual species for differences in abundance patterns, instead each row in the dataset would represent species composition (which can't be classified as native or non-native). So it wouldn't tell us if there's temporal partitioning by DOY between species or native and non-native species, it would only tell us if there different times of year have distinct species compositions.

If we do option 3 we need to decide what each row should be:

- One option is to have each row be DOY (then colour by month or a gradient from low to high DOY so we can more easilly see how different parts of the year cluster or if the DOY species compositions seem randomly dispersed).


I also tried doing the above analysis by summing abundance for each day of each year instead of each day across the years:
```{r}
# Log transform the abundance data using decostand? from the vegan package
logTLadyBug <- LadyBugData
logTLadyBug <- LadyBugData %>%
  mutate(logTAdults = decostand(LadyBugData$Adults, method = "log", 
                                logbase = 10, na.rm = T)) %>%  # transform with log10
  select(-Adults) # Replace Adults with logTAdults

# Could add a step here to split the dataset into subsets for relevant time periods. Would have to do the following steps separately for each time period.

# Pool abundance data for each day of each year for each species and for each habitat type

datYrDOY <- logTLadyBug %>%
  mutate(yrDOY = paste(as.factor(Year), as.factor(DOY), sep = ".")) %>% # Create a variable that combines the year and the DOY
  group_by(SpeciesID, TYPE, yrDOY) %>% summarize(SumAbun = sum(logTAdults, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # Sum the abundances by species, habitat type, and yrDOY (i.e. pooling observations from each station, plot, and treatment within the species + habitat type + yrDOY groups)
  pivot_wider(names_from = yrDOY, values_from = SumAbun) # Rearrange data.frame so abundance data is arranged as separate yrDOY columns

# For each habitat type, make matrices of species abundance where the rows are the individual species and the columns are yrDOY

# For forest habitat:
forest.specYrDOY <- datYrDOY %>% filter(TYPE == "forest")

forest.specYrDOY <- data.frame(forest.specYrDOY) # Convert from grouped data to a regular data.frame object

row.names(forest.specYrDOY) <- forest.specYrDOY$SpeciesID

forest.specYrDOY <- data.frame(forest.specYrDOY) %>% select(-SpeciesID, -TYPE) # Remove speciesID and habitat type from dataset so dist() can be run on it

head(forest.specYrDOY) 
```


```{r}
# Make distance matrix
forest.dist <- vegdist(forest.specYrDOY, method = "bray", na.rm = TRUE) # For now try bray-curtis dissimilarity. Will later try to find alternate distance of dissimilarity metrics in vegdist that control for biases caused by excessive abundance in particular species

# Display distance matrix with white representing no difference in temporal abundance between species and red representing the highest pairwise distance between species
PFdat <- melt(as.matrix(forest.dist))
ggplot(data = PFdat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=c("white","blue","green","red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```

More of the comparisons seem undefined now. I don't know why that is.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Make Neighbor-joining tree
forest.tree <- njs(forest.dist) # njs allows for missing values in the distance matrix

ggtree(forest.tree, layout = "rectangular") %<+% SpeciesOrigin +
  geom_tiplab(aes(colour = Species_type)) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

> A final note for these tree analyses: I wonder if part of the differences between species on the tree might reflect differences in the dates each species was sampled (i.e if some species only have data recorded for certain parts of the year while other species have data recorded for other parts of the year then maybe the pairwise distances between them partly reflect that?). Perhaps we could do histograms for the distributions of observation dates for the different species to see if there's any major differences.

> To possibily address the above point (not sure if it actully does), I tried replacing the NA values in the forest.specDOY object with 0s using the values_fill argument in the pivot_wider() function, but that didn't change the tree that was based off DOY abundances. However the tree built from YrDOY abundances did have it's topology changed when the NAs were switched to 0, but still there was little change in the overall pattern of Non-native plants being scattered throughout the tree (with only CSEPT and HAXY being reasonably close).

> It might also be worth trying the yrDOY abundance tree with the different log transformations. I don't think I tried but it's 2:00 am lol.



### A plot for demonstration of the custom function
 
```{r}
tempAbundancePlot <- ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x = DOY, y = Adults)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
tempAbundancePlot
```


## General temporal abundance patterns

Plot ladybeetle abundance against the day of the year to determine if abundance varies at all over time. Display this data separately for each individual habitat type (annual, forest, perennial) because the sampling method used to capture the ladybeetles may have been more efficient in some habitats than other habitats *(find Bahlai et al 2013 and cite it)*.
```{r}
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x = DOY, y = Adults)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```


Clearly abundance does vary over time, but not necessarily exactly according to month. Let's examine how well this pattern holds for individual species as well as native vs non-native assemblages.

## Temporal abundance of native vs non-native ladybeetles

Plotting abundance w/ native and non-native groupings
```{r}
ggplot(LadyBugData, aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()

# Trying the same thing as above but with the log transformed dataset
ggplot(logTLadyBug, aes(x = DOY, y = logTAdults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

Non-native ladybeetles clearly have higher abundance throughout the entire year in most habitats. There doesn't seem to be strong patterns in forest habitat for native ladybeetles, but this might just be because they have such low abundance. Taking a look at abundance pre-invasion of the various exotic species should help show what's going on.

Also, in annual crop habitats there seems to be a decline in non-native ladybeetle abundance and a concurrent increase in native ladybeetle abundance around 2/3 of the way through the year, lending support to our hypothesis of temporal niche partitioning.


## Pre-invasion temporal abundance patterns

1989 - 1993: one non-native ladybeetles
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1989:1993), TYPE != "forest") %>% # Filter the desired years and remove forest data (forest site only started getting sampled in 1993, so there is not enough data for this time frame)
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +

Native species are already low in abundance by this point, but seem to do well at the beginning and end of growing seasons.

1994 - 1998: two non-native ladybeetles
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1994:1998)) %>% # Filtering desired years, forests were present by this time period so they are left in the dataset
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

There is a very interesting change in abundance patterns for annual crops. There is now a second peak in abundance on non-native species at the end of the growing season.

Graphing by individual species (replace "Species_type" with "SpeciesID") shows that the increase in native abundance of is driven almost entirely by one species:
```{r}
LadyBugData$Adults <- as.numeric(LadyBugData$Adults)
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1994:1998)) %>% # Filtering desired years, forests were present by this time period so they are left in the dataset
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = SpeciesID)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```



1999 - 2006: three non-native ladybeetles + soybean aphid outbreaks
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(1999:2006)) %>% #filtering desired years
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

During this time period, a new, exotic ladybeetle species arrived and there were repeated soybean aphid outbreaks. Things get a little weird....

2007 - 2012: four non-native ladybeetles + soybean aphids present
```{r}
LadyBugData %>%
  filter(Year == c(2007:2012)) %>% #filtering desired years
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = Species_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```

That pattern of mid to late season niche partitioning becomes very apparent in annual cropland. Potentially related to agricultural activities (e.g. harvest)? Digging into the patterns for specific treatment types might explain more.

```{r}
LadyBugData %>% filter(TYPE == "annual", Year == c(2007:2012)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = DOY, y = Adults, colour = TREAT_DESC)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 1, se = F) +
  facet_wrap(~ TYPE) +
  theme_bw()
```



## Conclusion

Overall, abundance certainly varies over time and we see some evidence for niche partitioning at this stage. Invasion of new species also definitely has an impact on patterns.
